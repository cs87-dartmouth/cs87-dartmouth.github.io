**CS87/287: Rendering Algorithms**
  *Fall 2021* - [Dartmouth College](http://www.dartmouth.edu) -- Prof. [Wojciech Jarosz](http://cs.dartmouth.edu/~wjarosz)

How are the photorealistic images in animated films, visual effects, or architectural pre-visualization created?

This class focuses on advanced 3D graphics techniques for realistic image synthesis. You will learn how light interacts with objects in the real world, and how to translate the underlying math and physics into practical algorithms for rendering photorealistic images.

(#) Prerequisites

* COSC 11,
* COSC 50,
* or instructor's permission

We will rely on calculus, linear algebra and use basic concepts of algorithms and data structures. Students are expected to be familiar with the C++ programming language that we'll use in the programming assignments. Graduate students should have taken a course in multi-variable calculus equivalent to MATH 8.

Coursework
=====================================================================

This is a project-based course, and the majority of your grade will come from programming assignments, which you'll find in the Assignments section of the website. There will also be in-class hand-written quizzes and/or an exam. I will post slides online after lecture, which you can access in the Files section, or by clicking on the corresponding lecture in the course Calendar. Check the weekly schedule below.

For the programming assignments, you will initially receive a very basic ray tracing framework that lacks most rendering-related functionality. As we discuss various concepts in class (the physics of light, how light interacts with surfaces and volumes, the Monte Carlo method and sampling), you will apply that knowledge in a series of programming assignments, implementing increasingly sophisticated rendering algorithms in your own software.

By the end of the quarter your software will have a basic set of features allowing you to create simple photorealistic images by simulating the physics of light in a virtual scene. In the last programming assignment you will implement a set of additional features of your own choosing and create a photorealistic image that is both technically and artistically compelling.


Textbooks
=====================================================================

Beyond lecture material, we will rely on four books in this class:

![](https://raytracing.github.io/images/RTOneWeekend.jpg height=200) ![](https://raytracing.github.io/images/RTNextWeek.jpg height=200) ![](https://raytracing.github.io/images/RTRestOfYourLife.jpg height=200) ![](https://www.pbrt.org/images/bookcover.png height=200)

Firstly, we will be using Peter Shirley's excellent and very accessible _Ray tracing_ series of 3 mini e-books. These books are short, fun and informal – more like blog posts than textbooks – and are a great way to get started on this exciting topic. We will refer to these as Shirley1, Shirley2, and Shirley3. We will primarily focus our attention on these books in the beginning of the class.

On the other end of the spectrum, we will be also be using _Physically Based Rendering, Third Edition: From Theory To Implementation_ by Matt Pharr, Wenzel Jakob, and Greg Humphreys. This is a big (sometimes intimidating) textbook, with all the mathematical details you will need to dive deep into the rendering topic of this class. We will use this mostly as a reference to complement the Shirley mini-books and lecture but will also increasingly shift our focus to this book as the quarter progresses.

Obtaining the books
-------------------

Luckily, you don't have to pay a lot to get any of these textbooks!

You can download Shirley's Ray tracing series for free here ([In One Weekend](http://www.realtimerendering.com/raytracing/Ray%20Tracing%20in%20a%20Weekend.pdf), [The Next Week](http://www.realtimerendering.com/raytracing/Ray%20Tracing_%20The%20Next%20Week.pdf), [The Rest Of Your Life](http://www.realtimerendering.com/raytracing/Ray%20Tracing_%20the%20Rest%20of%20Your%20Life.pdf)). Alternatively, you can purchase the Kindle version of this series from Amazon ([In One Weekend](https://amazon.com/dp/B01B5AODD8), [The Next Week](https://amazon.com/dp/B01CO7PQ8C), [The Rest Of Your Life](https://amazon.com/dp/B01DN58P8C)). Half of the proceeds of these sales go to [Hack the Hood](https://hackthehood.org/), a really neat organization.

The can access PDFs of the individual chapters of PBRT through [Science Direct](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/book/9780128006450) if you are accessing it from a Dartmouth IP address.

Assigned reading
----------------

There will be reading from these book each week to supplement the material discussed in lecture. I'll list the relevant reading in the description of the corresponding lecture event in the Calendar.


Learning Outcomes
=================

By the end of the course, you will be able to:

*   Explain the physical quantities of light transport and perform basic computations using pencil & paper
*   Explain a variety of models describing how light interacts with different materials
*   Explain the rendering and radiative transfer equations and show how to construct Monte Carlo methods to solve them
*   Design and implement an advanced rendering system based on Monte Carlo integration
*   Assess / evaluate the strengths, weakness, and capabilities of various rendering algorithms


Grading Scheme
==============

Grading Component       |  Percentage
------------------------|-------------
Programming assignments | 50%
Exam(s)/Quizzes:        | 25%
Final project:          | 20%
Participation           | 5%

!!! WARNING: Disclaimer!
    This grade breakdown is subject to adjustments.


Graduate & Extra Credit
-----------------------

Grads and undergrads enrolled in the class will be graded separately and we will generally grade grads more strictly. Additionally, the programming assignments will sometimes include extra portions that will be required for grads and may count as extra credit for undergrads. We will grade these separately and grant extra credit only if the foundation of the original assignment has been completed correctly (e.g., at least 90% of the original requirements/grade are met).

Occasionally we will include the possibility to earn “Hacker Points”. Hacker Points are “underpriced” bonus points for the daring few. Sometimes this might require implementing something that was not taught in class or something that requires some additional research and creative thinking. Hacker Points are awarded only to students who implemented all of the remaining assignment. In addition Hacker Points are either fully awarded or not awarded at all.

At the end of the course, extra credit and hacker points will not be added directly to your score. Instead, we will consider your extra credit to potentially round your grade more favorably when discretizing to letter grades.


Submission Deadlines & Grading
------------------------------

Students will turn in their code through Canvas, and we will have a **strict deadline**. We will strive to post programming assignment grades on Canvas within roughly a week of the due date. The assignments will build off of each other, so you do not want to fall behind! There is a stiff penalty for late submissions, as discussed in the first lecture. Exception to this rule might be made for special cases only if the professor is informed well before (e.g. not a couple days before) the deadline, or in the case of a medical emergency, and at the professor’s sole discretion.

It’s up to you to check that assignments have been successfully submitted to Canvas; if there are any problems, you must notify course staff by email immediately (not weeks later, claiming “Canvas ate it”).


Rendering Competition
=====================

The class culminates with a final project and rendering competition. The purpose of the final project is to add additional advanced features to your rendering software and compete with your classmates to generate the most photorealistic image. Each student will choose an motivational image/scene which they would like to recreate virtually using their software, and must implement the necessary features to achieve their artistic vision. Students will briefly present their final projects during the final exam period to a panel of expert judges, who will evaluate the entries both in terms of technical achievement and artistic quality.

!!! WARNING:
    Participation in the final project presentations is mandatory. This is scheduled during our final exam period, which is November 26th, 8am-11am. Put this in your calendar.

Policies
=====================================================================

Student Accessibility and Accommodations
----------------------------------------

Students requesting disability-related accommodations and services for this course should schedule a phone/Zoom meeting with me within the first week of the term. This conversation will help to establish what supports are built into my course.

The remainder is standard text provided by Dartmouth [[here](https://dcal.dartmouth.edu/resources/course-design-preparation/syllabus-guide)].

>
> In order for accommodations to be authorized, students are required to consult with Student Accessibility Services (SAS; [Getting Started with SAS webpage](https://students.dartmouth.edu/student-accessibility/students/working-sas/getting-started); student.accessibility.services@dartmouth.edu; 603-646-9900) and to request an accommodation email be sent to me. We will then work together with SAS if accommodations need to be modified based on the learning environment. If students have questions about whether they are eligible for accommodations, they should contact the SAS office. All inquiries and discussions will remain confidential.

Mental Health and Awareness
------------------------------

The following is standard text provided by Dartmouth [[here](https://dcal.dartmouth.edu/resources/course-design-preparation/syllabus-guide)].

>
> The academic environment at Dartmouth is challenging, our terms are intensive, and classes are not the only demanding part of your life. There are a number of resources available to you on campus to support your wellness, including your [undergraduate dean](https://students.dartmouth.edu/undergraduate-deans/), [Counseling and Human Development](https://students.dartmouth.edu/health-service/counseling/about), and the [Student Wellness Center](https://students.dartmouth.edu/wellness-center/). I encourage you to use these resources to take care of yourself throughout the term, and to come speak to me if you experience any difficulties.

## Respect, Diversity, and Inclusion

I would like to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, etc.). To help accomplish this:

If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official college records, please include them in your zoom display name, or let me know privately.

If at any time you feel uncomfortable about the interactions in our (virtual) classroom I encourage you to contact me privately so I can better understand how I can manage the course; indeed, I am eager for feedback about how I can maximize everyone’s experience. If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, likewise, please don’t hesitate to contact me. I want to be a resource for you. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, the contacts in the Mental Health and Wellness section above can be an excellent resource.

I (like many people) am constantly learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it.

As a participant in course discussions, you should also strive to honor and respect the diversity of your classmates.

## Title IX

The following is standard text provided by Dartmouth [[here](https://dcal.dartmouth.edu/resources/course-design-preparation/syllabus-guide)].

Health addendum
---------------------------------------------------------------------

While the COVID-19 pandemic has already drastically disrupted this course, it has the potential to result in further personal impact which may prevent you from continuing engagement in the class. This may be due to contraction of the disease by you or a loved one, increased familial responsibilities, financial difficulties, or impacts on your mental/emotional health.

I have structured the course so that, hopefully, these disruptions will not prevent you from successfully learning the material.

In the event that you are directly or indirectly impacted by COVID-19 in such a way that will affect your performance in the course, it is imperative that you reach out to the instructor(s) as soon as possible. You may also reach out to your undergraduate Dean if that would make you more comfortable. We cannot assist you if we don’t know there is a problem. Our first priority is your health and security. We will work to put you in touch with appropriate resources to assist you.

Consent to recording
---------------------------------------------------------------------

I’ll be recording all of our lectures that occur at the scheduled time, so that those who cannot be there due to poor internet connectivity or time zones can watch later. Dartmouth has asked that I include the following language describing some bounds on how recording should be used. You do not need to send me any sort of agreement on this – it just makes clear that you shouldn’t record or distribute any recordings without my consent.

The remainder is standard text provided by Dartmouth [[here](https://dcal.dartmouth.edu/resources/course-design-preparation/syllabus-guide)].

1. Consent to recording of course meetings and office hours that are open to multiple students.

  By enrolling in this course,

    a) I affirm my understanding that the instructor may record meetings of this course and any associated meetings open to multiple students and the instructor, including but not limited to scheduled and ad hoc office hours and other consultations, within any digital platform, including those used to offer remote instruction for this course.

    b) I further affirm that the instructor owns the copyright to their instructional materials, of which these recordings constitute a part, and my distribution of any of these recordings in whole or in part to any person or entity other than other members of the class without prior written consent of the instructor may be subject to discipline by Dartmouth up to and including separation from Dartmouth.

2. Requirement of consent to one-on-one recordings

  By enrolling in this course, I hereby affirm that I will not make a recording in any medium of any *one-on-one meeting with the instructor or another member of the class or group of members of the class* without obtaining the prior written consent of all those participating, and I understand that if I violate this prohibition, I will be subject to discipline by Dartmouth up to and including separation from Dartmouth, as well as any other civil or criminal penalties under applicable law. I understand that an exception to this consent applies to accommodations approved by SAS for a student's disability, and that one or more students in a class may record class lectures, discussions, lab sessions, and review sessions and take pictures of essential information, and/or be provided class notes for personal study use only.

If you have questions, please contact the Office of the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
